                    <p>The hobbits, also known as halflings are an ancient mortal race living in middle earth, 
                        although with unknown origins they were found in norther middle earth and eventually 
                        settled and founded the land known as the shire. </p>
                    <p>If you find yourself in the shire you'll find that the hobbits tend to be a friendly and peaceful people,
                         though they can tend to be suspicious and distant of people of other lands whom they ofter referred to as "outsiders".
                        As most Hobbits like to live a peaceful and quiet life it'd be better to stay away from adventure and stick to Pipe-weed, which is an all time favourite to smoke.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you'd like to live and fit in with the hobbits get ready for a good time, with tobacco they call pipe weed, seven different meals a day and much partying and ale. 
                        If you're looking to get in the good favour of the hobbits it'd be a good start to offer gifts of mushrooms or other simple foods, with cake being one exception they are particularly fond of.
                        </p>
