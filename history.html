                    <h3><a>History</a></h3>
                    <p>Hobbits are an old race of middle earth unknown as to when they first appeared as when first discovered by the people of middle earth they had been around for many generations.
                        Around the year TA 1050 the Hobbits crossed the Misty Mountains, it was assumed this was due to Saurons overtaking of the lands they were on. 
                        Once they settled down, the difference between the hobbit tribes began to blur and they slowly became the hobbits we know today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around the year 1601 of the Third age a group of Hobbits got permision to cross the River of Baranduin, bringing with them many Hobbits.
                        Once crossed they settled on a hilly land known as the Shire and in doing so they swore allegiance to the last kings of Arthedain until said kingdom was destroyed.
                        The Hobbits soon chose a Thain from a chieftan but they soon left so they chose another, the Thain was in charge of the "military" force of the Shire yet that proved to be more of a formality title than anything, considering the peaceful life the Hobbits lived
                        The Mayor was considered the position of actual power in the Shire as they oversaw the post and control of the law in town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually over much time the Hobbits numbers declined as did their height and by the Fourth Age they were seen as almost gone from the lands yet sometimes they are still spoken of in the present tense giving hope that they are still alive and thriving.
